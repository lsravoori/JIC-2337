# For the People

An easy to use application which allows users to find local minority/women-owned businesses in a specific zip code to find their respective needs.

Current iteration of the project includes business names. When clicking on these names, the information will display in a new screen.

Future iterations will include log-in pages with different options for users, business, and admin. In addition reviewing the business and flagging them is another major 
feature that we are looking to implement. Admin features such as reviewing businesses is also high in our priorities.

The code consists mainly of Flutter for Android/IOS as the front end. And firebase for the database and cloud utilization. Expansion into using Java Spring Boot is 
considered as the code base continues to grow.
